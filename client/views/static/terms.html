	  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

	  <h2>Background</h2>

	  <p>Thank you for being responsible and reading the Terms. We (Crowducate) would love to hear your <a href="mailto:info@crowducate.me">feedback</a> on how they could evolve in the future. We have some big ideas on how they could be better and our lawyer is working hard on some custom terms for the site now. Unfortunately, they were not ready in time for launch so we borrowed these from the folks behind <a href="https://cupcake.io/terms">Cupcake</a> who generously published theirs under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">license</a>. Cupcake in turn, got their terms from <a href="https://en.wordpress.com/tos/">Wordpress/Automattic</a>. The terms below are also published under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">same license</a>. Please get in touch if you have any questions. We know some stuff won't make sense - we are working on it.</p>
