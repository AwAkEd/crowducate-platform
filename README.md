# Installation
The Crowducate platform is based on [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/ "MeteorJS"). So, if you want to run it locally: 

1.	[Install MeteorJS](https://github.com/meteor/meteor "Install Meteor Guide GitHub")
2.	Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/Crowducate/crowducate.me.git
3.	Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where Crowducate is installed. 
4.	Don't update meteor. The current version only works with Meteor 0.83
5.	Run “mrt install” (assuming you have installed meteorite)

That’s it!

# License
