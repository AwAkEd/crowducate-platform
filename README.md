# Install (only relevant for the old master-branch): 

The Crowducate platform is based on [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/ "MeteorJS"). So, if you want to run it locally: 

1.	Install [MeteorJS](https://github.com/meteor/meteor "Install Meteor Guide GitHub")
2.	Install [Meteorite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meteorite)
3.	Clone Crowducate: `git clone https://github.com/Crowducate/crowducate.me.git`
4.	Change to Crowducate directory: `cd crowducate.me`
5.	Run `mrt install`

*Note:* The development branch works with Meteor 1.x.

Thatâ€™s it!
