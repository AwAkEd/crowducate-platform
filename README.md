# Development Status
We are currently building the 1.0 version of Crowducate. You can download and try the [1.0 Alpha version](https://github.com/Crowducate/crowducate-platform/releases/tag/1.0.0-a1).

If you would like to contribute to the development efforts, please checkout our [development branch](https://github.com/Crowducate/crowducate-platform/tree/develop).

## Installing 1.x Alpha
1. Download the most recent [1.x release](https://github.com/Crowducate/crowducate-platform/releases)
2. Extract the archive file to a location on your computer
3. Change to the extracted directory in your console
4. Type `meteor` to start the server
5. Test and let us know your thoughts :-)

# Install (only relevant for the old master-branch): 

The Crowducate platform is based on [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/ "MeteorJS"). So, if you want to run it locally: 

1.	Install [MeteorJS](https://github.com/meteor/meteor "Install Meteor Guide GitHub")
2.	Install [Meteorite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meteorite)
3.	Clone Crowducate: `git clone https://github.com/Crowducate/crowducate.me.git`
4.	Change to Crowducate directory: `cd crowducate.me`
5.	Run `mrt install`

*Note:* The development branch works with Meteor 1.x.

Thatâ€™s it!

*Note: * Don't update meteor. The current version only works with Meteor 0.83
