# Gitflow
Our project follows the Gitflow development process. As such,

* All new features should be made by branching `develop`
* New feature branches should start with `feature/` followed by the hyphenated name of the feature

# Work in progress
Please keep work in progress updated on Github. This helps the team know what tasks are in progress, and gives an opportunity to help with the task.
